                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Older homes can be a great investment, either to flip, keep as a rental, or to live in. However, if you are considering buying an older home there are a lot of potential issues you should be aware of. Not all old homes have these problems, and not all these problems are deal breakers. But it is important to be aware of what to look for, because the older the home, the more complicated and expensive the repairs can be.
                        <br><br>
                        Of course, finding issues isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes if you discover these issues during the home inspection process, you can use your findings to negotiate a better price.
                        <br><br>
                        Here are some issues to watch out for when purchasing an older home, and some suggestions on what to do if you encounter these situations.
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Lead-Based Paint</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Lead-based paint was commonly used in older homes, but it was banned in 1978. So, if the house you are looking at was built before 1978 it may have lead paint. The odds that the home has lead paint go up significantly if it was built 1959 and go up again if it was built before 1940. In fact, almost 90% of homes built before 1940 have lead paint.
                        <br><br>
                        Lead paint isn't always a major issue. Typically, if the paint is in good condition and isn't chipped or peeling, then it can be covered with a fresh layer of new paint, and that will contain the issue. Surfaces that get a lot of wear and tear such as handrails, window sills, and doors are the most likely places where lead paint is going to be an issue. Also, if you are doing demolition work on an older home with lead paint, that can be potentially hazardous as destroying painted surfaces can create toxic lead dust.
                        <br><br>
                        If you do find the home in question has problems with lead paint, you may discover that you need have a professional deal with the issue.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Asbestos Hazards</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Asbestos is an outdated building material that was commonly used in homes built before 1980. Asbestos can be found in building materials such as insulation around pipes, glue for vinyl flooring, attic insulation, siding, plaster, and more. Asbestos can be very harmful to your health. Breathing asbestos fibers can cause lung problems and cancer. 
                        <br><br>
                        Finding asbestos in your house isn't always a deal-breaker. You will likely need to do a deeper assessment to determine how large the problem is, but in some cases, you may be alright as long as it hasn't been disturbed. If however, there is a large amount of asbestos in the home or it has been disturbed, you may need to have a licensed contractor perform an abatement. This can be costly because it's a hazardous job, so if you find yourself in this position, prepare yourself that it may take longer, and cost more than you originally hoped.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Faulty Sewer Lines</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Sewer lines can occasionally become blocked or damaged over time. Which can make them an issue when working with older homes. If you are evaluating a home that is 30 years old or older, it may be worth the money to have a contractor inspect the sewer line for issues prior to closing. Another reason you may want to have a professional inspect the sewer line is if the property in question has large trees near the sewer line that may have damaged the pipe with their roots.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, old houses sometimes are not connected to the city sewer but instead are run to an underground septic tank nearby. A good rule of thumb when buying real estate is to never assume anything about the infrastructure of the home. I knew a guy who bought an older home, and the sellers said the sewer was connected to the city. But after buying the house and moving in the buyer realized the sewer line actually ran to a septic tank in the backyard. As a result, he had to have a new sewer line installed and ended up suing the seller for it. The whole situation was a mess, and it could have been avoided upfront if the buyer had made sure to inspect the sewer line before purchasing.
                        <br><br>
                        Replacing a sewer line can cost thousands of dollars, which means if your property is at risk of having a decayed or damaged sewer line, it may be worth paying a hundred dollars or so to have a professional come inspect it for you before closing on the property. If issues do come up, you can negotiate with the seller.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Termite Damage</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Depending on your location, you may need to be wary of termite problems. Termites live in almost every state but are more prevalent in warmer climates. Additionally, termites are more likely to be a problem in older homes with crumbling foundations or rotting boards or drywall. 
                        <br><br>
                        If you notice any signs of termite damage such as rotted wood, or sagging floors you can have a professional inspector evaluate the damage and give you an idea of what kind of treatment would be needed to correct the problem and how much that is likely to cost.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Unstable Foundations</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Foundation issues can be a big problem, so you want to make sure you are aware of any issues prior to purchasing a property. Foundation issues are commonly caused when the ground underneath the home settles and causes the whole structure to move slightly. When evaluating a home, pay attention to the foundation walls. If they are bowed or cracked it may indicate there are structural issues. Additionally, if the home is a brick home look to see if you notice any cracks in the grout lines, as that may also be an indicator of foundation issues.
                        <br><br>
                        If you notice the concrete in the driveway is cracked, that isn't necessarily cause for alarm. Most driveways are connected directly to the home's foundation, so some cracked concrete out front doesn't mean you have a big problem. However, if the concrete has shifted in such a way that water runs towards the house, that is something you would want to get fixed. Any water running towards the home increases the chance of having foundation problems in the future. You can usually fix sunken concrete fairly easily by having a contractor spray expanding foam under the slab and raising it to the proper height.
                        <br><br>
                        An additional item to note is that older homes weren't always built as structurally sound as the are today. They didn't always have to follow the same codes and compaction standards as they do nowadays. So if you are working with an older home, pay extra close attention to the foundation.
                        <br><br>
                        Repairing or replacing the foundation on an existing home is an expensive and time-consuming process that often scares a lot of potential investors away. If it's something you aren't comfortable with, it may be a good reason to pass on a property. However, if it's something you manage, it may be a way for you to get a good deal on a property that other people are avoiding.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Outdated Electrical</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Older homes can have some unique challenges when it comes to electrical issues. And it's important to make sure you don't have any serious problems that could cause a fire in the home. 
                        <br><br>
                        The following is a list of potential problems you may discover when working with old homes:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul class="blog-post-list">
                            <li>Flickering or dimming lights</li>
                            <li>Light bulbs burn out frequently</li>
                            <li>Frequently tripping breakers</li>
                            <li>Aluminum wiring</li>
                            <li>Not enough circuits</li>
                            <li>Missing GFCIs</li>
                            <li>Dirty or damaged receptacles, switches, and covers</li>
                        </ul>
                        Some of these problems are easier to solve than others. For example, replacing dirty light switch covers is a very easy job. It's not dangerous, and many real estate investors choose to replace all the switches, outlets, and covers in the entire house when they go to sell, because it's a quick and inexpensive way to make the home feel clean and new.
                        <br><br>
                        Not having enough circuits is an issue that a lot of older houses face. This is in part due to the fact that when the home was built, electric devices weren't as common as they are today. Now, when we plug in all our devices, we overload the circuit and end up tripping breakers or putting a lot of strain on the system.
                        <br><br>
                        Most electrical issues can be remedied for a reasonable price without too much trouble. Minor electrical repairs usually aren't a reason to avoid investing in a property, but if something about the property makes you nervous, you can always ask a professional for their opinion.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Plumbing Problems</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Plumbing issues are a common occurrence when dealing with old homes. Fortunately, most plumbing issues can be repaired easily. They usually aren't a big enough concern to cause you to walk away from a good deal.
                        <br><br>
                        Let's look briefly at a few potential plumbing problems you may run into:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul class="blog-post-list">
                            <li>Lead in the water - Some homes have lead pipes which if not addressed can cause lead poisoning. If you discover the home you're working on has lead pipes, you should address the issue. Fortunately, resolving the issue is often as simple as installing a filtration system to remove any lead or other harmful contaminants from the water.</li>
                            <li>Galvanized pipe - Homes built prior to the early 60's often used galvanized iron pipe for the water supply lines. If you come across a home that uses this type of pipe, recognize that the supply lines will probably need to be replaced since galvanized pipe corrodes over time and can block the water flow or start leaking.</li>
                            <li>Water heaters - During the home inspection process take a look at the label on the water heater to see when it was manufactured / installed. If you notice the water heater is expired or is showing any signs of corrosion you will likely want to replace the unit. This usually isn't a difficult process, and a plumber should be able to complete the job in just a few hours.</li>
                            <li>Sprinklers - Most properties with a lawn also have a sprinkler system. Whether or not you should fix a damaged sprinkler system varies depending on where you are, and what your goals are. Many buyers are not afraid to work on a sprinkler system themselves, so it is often something you won't need to fix. However, if you are flipping a home and trying to sell it in the summer. Having a green lawn is a good way to improve the curb appeal of the home, and a functioning sprinkler system is going to be very useful for getting that green lawn.</li>
                        </ul>                        
                        If you do find yourself evaluating a home that will need plumbing work its good to note that if the home is a single-story rambler with a crawl space or an unfinished basement, it will be much easier and more cost effective to do repairs than if you need to make the same repairs on a two story home with finished walls.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Damaged Roofs</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        If you're considering purchasing an older home be sure to ask when the roof was last replaced and inspect the roof for damage. The fact of the matter is that roofs eventually wear out and need replaced. You'll want to know whether the roof needs replaced or not before you buy a property because replacing the shingles on a roof is an expensive process. 
                        <br><br>
                        Also, replacing a roof, makes the home easier to sell, but it doesn't make the home sell for more. This means knowing whether the house needs a new roof or not is especially important if you're an investor looking to flip the house since buying a new roof will eat into your profits.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Always Use Common Sense</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        In this article we've examined a handful of potential issues you may run into when dealing with old houses. However, old houses do not have a monopoly on these problems, and you may run into these same issues in newer homes as well.
                        <br><br>
                        As always, use common sense when evaluating a property or trying to fix a problem. Every house and situation is unique, and good judgement is needed to make the best decision for each scenario. I hope you found this article helpful.
