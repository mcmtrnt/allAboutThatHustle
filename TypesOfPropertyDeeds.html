                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        If you're investing in real estate, you need to understand what a deed is, how they work, and what the different kinds of deeds are. A deed is a document used to transfer ownership of an asset from one party to another. When dealing with real estate, there are four main types of deeds. Each type of deed differs in the warrants (guarantees) that it gives to the buyer. Some deeds favor the seller, while others favor the buyer. Depending on which position you're in, it's important to understand the differences so you can minimize the amount of risk you're taking.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">General Warranty Deed</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        General warranty deeds are the most common types of deeds. They are used to transfer fee simple ownership, which means full ownership of the land and buildings without any limitations other than local zoning ordinances. General warranty deeds are the best option for a buyer because it guarantees the the seller has the full title and it protects you against anyone who might try to make a claim against the title after you have purchased the property. Additionally, it promises that the title will be transferred without any defects, liens, or encumbrances. If you are a buyer, you should require a general warranty deed in almost all cases.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Special Warranty Deed</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        A special warranty deed offers less protection for a buyer than a general warranty deed. And as a buyer, if you are offered a special warranty deed, you should be cautious about closing the deal. A special warranty deed only guarantees that the seller has acquired the title and has done nothing to impair it. But it makes no guarantees about what may have happened to the title before the seller acquired it. This means you are not protected from someone who claims the title is theirs after you have purchased the property.
                        <br><br>
                        One exception when it may be ok to accept a special warranty deed is if you are buying a foreclosure property. Often, the public officials selling the title will use a special warranty deed because they don't know the history of the title.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Bargain and Sale Deed</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        A bargain and sale deed indicates that the seller holds the title and can transfer ownership, but it offers no guarantees to the buyer. This means the seller or any past owners may have impaired the title, or other people may have legal claims to the title as well.
                        <br><br>
                        To make this type of deed more favorable to the buyer you can add covenants to the deed which make it very similar to a general warranty deed. And, in some states such as New York, bargain and sale deeds are very common and are often used in place of a general warranty deed.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Quitclaim Deed</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        A quitclaim deed has no promises or warranties of any kind. Instead the seller simply transfers whatever ownership of the property they may or may not have. It is the most risky type of deed, and as a result shouldn't be used to purchase real estate.
                        <br><br>
                        While quitclaim deeds aren't used to buy and sell real estate, they do have a purpose. Most often they are used to transfer title between family members in special situations. Such as during a divorce, or when parents want to transfer title to a child. Additionally, quitclaim deeds may be used to clear up title issues. For example, if an issue arises where another person may have claim against a title they can sign a quitclaim deed to make sure the buyer has full ownership of the complete title.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Elements of a Property Deed</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Now that we've examined the differences between the different types of deeds let's examine the elements they have in common:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul class="blog-post-list">
                            <li>Must be in writing</li>
                            <li>Must specify both the grantor (seller) and the grantee (buyer)</li>
                            <li>Must contain a legal description of the property</li>
                            <li>Must contain words of conveyance (a clause that states the grantor intends to convey title of the land to the grantee)</li>
                            <li>Must be signed by the grantor</li>
                            <li>Acknowledgement by notary</li>
                        </ul>
                        Additionally, it's important to note that the title to a property does not transfer ownership until it is delivered to the grantee. Usually, the escrow company takes part in this process.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Do I need Title Insurance?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Regardless of the type of deed you are using, if you are purchasing real estate it is recommended you get title insurance. Title insurance is a one-time upfront fee you pay when you purchase a house that helps protect you against claims against your property. Real estate is a large investment, and it makes sense to protect it.
