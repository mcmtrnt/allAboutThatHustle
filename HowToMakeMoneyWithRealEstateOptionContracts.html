                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">What is an Option Contract?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        A real estate option contract is a legally binding document between a buyer and seller that gives the buyer exclusive rights to purchase the property at an agreed upon price within a specified time period. Here's how it typically works. A buyer will give the seller an agreed upon, non-trivial, sum of money in exchange for the exclusive right to purchase the property within a specified time frame, usually 6 - 12 months, and for a specific price, usually the current market value of the property. When an option contract is signed, the seller cannot sell the property to anyone else until the contract expires. The buyer may exercise the contract at any point and force the sale of the property at that time. However, the buyer is not obligated to purchase the property and can walk away from the deal at any time or let the contract expire. If the buyer chooses not to purchase the property, the seller will keep the option fee that was paid by the buyer when the contract was signed. If the buyer does purchase the property, the seller will sometimes apply the option fee towards the purchase price.

                        Option contracts are a unique way to purchase property and it gives the buyer several distinct advantages and opportunities traditional purchasing methods can't provide. For example, the buyer can negotiate large deals with limited risk. Additionally, it allows for new methods to make money in the real estate market. Let's look at a few examples of how this can be done.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Property Appreciation</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        If a buyer expects a property to appreciate in value in the near future, they may use an option contract to tie up the property and ensure they have exclusive rights to purchase it. Then the buyer waits until the property value increases at which time they can buy the property and resell it for a higher price, or they can sell the option contract to another buyer. This is a great option if the buyer is looking for a way to make a profit but doesn't have the funds to buy the property outright. An additional advantage is that the option contract limits the buyer's risk. If the buyer purchases an option contract and the property doesn't appreciate in value, the buyer is not obligated to purchase the property. They can walk away from the deal losing only the money spent on acquiring the contract. Losing a few thousand dollars is a much better situation than losing hundreds of thousands of dollars on a property that declines in value.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Rezoning</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Another option available to investors is to look at rezoning properties. Rather than waiting for a property to appreciate, an investor can purchase an option contract for a property and then attempt to increase it's value by rezoning it. For example, if you are able to get the city to agree to rezone a specific property from residential to commercial you may significantly increase the value of the property. At which time you can purchase the property at the previously agreed price and then resell it to a commercial builder for a much higher price. Rezoning is not an easy task, it takes a lot of time and you may have to navigate through a lot of red tape, but it is clever way to make a considerable amount of money quickly and with little risk.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Buy Time for Additional Funding</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        One of the most common ways option contracts are used is with large commercial real estate deals. Sometimes a buyer will want to purchase a property, but they need more time to acquire funding or to finish other projects first. In these scenarios, they can use an option contract to ensure that no one else can buy the property they want. Later, when the have the time and money to purchase the property, they can do so. This is a great way to make sure they are able to get the property the want. Option contracts are a great tool to ensure that builders and investors don't miss out on a great deal.
