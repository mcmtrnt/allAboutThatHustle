                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">What is a Real Estate Option Contract?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        A real estate option contract, also sometimes called an option to buy, is a legally binding document between a buyer and seller that gives the buyer 
                        exclusive rights to purchase the property at an agreed upon price within a specified time period. 
                        <br><br>
                        Here's how it typically works. A buyer will give the seller an agreed upon, non-trivial, sum of money (usually 1-5% of the purchase price) 
                        in exchange for the exclusive right to purchase the property within a specified time frame, usually 6 - 12 months, and for an agreed upon price, 
                        usually the current market value of the property. 
                        <br><br>
                        When an option contract is signed, the seller cannot sell the property to anyone else until the contract expires. The buyer may exercise the 
                        contract at any point and force the sale of the property at that time. However, the buyer is not obligated to purchase the property and can 
                        walk away from the deal at any time or let the contract expire. If the buyer chooses not to purchase the property, the seller will keep the 
                        option fee that was paid by the buyer when the contract was signed. If the buyer does purchase the property, the seller will sometimes apply 
                        the option fee towards the purchase price.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Why Would a Real Estate Investor Want to Buy an Option Contract?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Option contracts are a unique way to purchase property and it gives the buyer several distinct advantages and opportunities traditional 
                        purchasing methods can't provide.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps the biggest advantage of investors gain from real estate options is the ability to control a property without ever owning the 
                        property. This means you can negotiate large deals with limited risk and avoid all the headache of obtaining financing, paying realtor fees, 
                        and the other hassles involved with owning a property. Instead, with real estate options you have the exclusive right to purchase a property 
                        and you can assign or sell your right to purchase to another party. This means you can profit from real estate transactions without ever 
                        owning the property.
                        <br><br>
                        Let's look at a few examples of how to make money with real estate option contracts.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Property Appreciation</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        If an investor expects a property to appreciate in value in the near future, they may use an option contract to tie up the property 
                        and ensure they have exclusive rights to purchase it. Then the investor waits until the property value increases, at which time 
                        they can buy the property and resell it for a higher price, or they can sell the option contract to another buyer. 
                        <br><br>
                        Selling the option contract is a great choice 
                        if the buyer is looking for a way to make a profit but doesn't have the funds to buy the property outright. An additional advantage is that the 
                        option contract limits the buyer's risk. If the buyer purchases an option contract and the property doesn't appreciate, the buyer is 
                        not obligated to purchase the property. They can walk away from the deal losing only the money spent on acquiring the contract. Losing a few 
                        thousand dollars from a bad option contract is a much lower risk situation than losing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars by purchasing a 
                        property that declines in value.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Resell Undervalued Property</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Undervalued properties make great candidates for option contract investors. Specifically, I'm talking about properties that are vacant, vandalized, filthy, have 
                        title problems, used to be meth labs, or have other problems that scare away typical real estate investors. Properties like this can often be purchased at a 
                        steep discount, then with a little cleanup and a little marketing, they can be resold to a buyer or another investor. Often, the really good deals for option 
                        contracts, aren't listed for sale on the MLS. Instead, it takes some work to find the right property, track down the owner, and negotiate a deal with them.
                        <br><br>
                        Properties in distress are also a good pick for option investors because the property owners are more likely to be motivated and may be more likely to sign an 
                        option contract.
                        <br><br>
                        When dealing with option contracts it's recommended to keep the option fee below 5% of the agreed upon purchase price, and do your best to negotiate a purchase 
                        price that is at least 20% below market value. Following these simple guidelines helps ensure the deals you make will be profitable and will be worth your time.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Rezoning</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Another option available to investors is rezoning properties. Rather than waiting for a property to appreciate or dealing with distressed properties, 
                        an investor can purchase an option contract for a property that is zoned as low value property type and then attempt to increase its value by rezoning it for 
                        a more profitable use. For example, if you can get the city to rezone a property from low-density residential to commercial you may significantly increase 
                        the resale value of the property. At which time you can use your option contract to purchase the property at the previously agreed price and then resell 
                        it to a commercial builder for a much higher price. Rezoning is not an easy task, it takes a lot of time, and you may have to navigate through a lot of red tape, 
                        but it is clever way to make a considerable amount of money quickly and with little risk.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Buy Time for Additional Funding</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        One of the most common ways option contracts are used is with large commercial real estate deals. Sometimes a buyer will want to purchase a property, 
                        but they need more time to acquire funding or to finish other projects first. In these scenarios, they can use an option contract to ensure that no one 
                        else can buy the property they want. Later, when the have the time and money to purchase the property, they can do so. This is a great way to make sure 
                        they can get the property they want. Option contracts are a great tool to ensure that builders and investors don't miss out on a great deal or a 
                        great location.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Tips for Success</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        We have covered four of the best ways to make money with real estate option contracts. If you find the right deal, option contracts can create low-risk, 
                        high-reward investments. However, to make these deals work you need to be sure and do your homework first. There is no substitute for thorough research. 
                        In the business of real estate investing, it is critical that you verify all the information you are given and that you perform proper due diligence 
                        including title and property inspections before you shell out any money or sign any contracts. Additionally, note that it is almost always a good idea to 
                        hire competent professionals to assist you with any areas you lack expertise. It is highly recommended that you hire a qualified real estate 
                        lawyer who is familiar with real estate option contracts to help you write up the necessary contracts and avoid any legal loopholes or pitfalls.
