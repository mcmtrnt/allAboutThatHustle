                        Knowing how to analyze a neighborhood is a key skill for a real estate investor. Being able to accurately assess the quality of the area helps you gain a better understanding of what a home in that area is worth and will help you understand who might want to buy that home and why. The number one factor in real estate investing is location, location, location. It's difficult to overstate the importance of buying properties in the right location. Hopefully, after reading this article, you will be better able to evaluate a neighborhood and understand the factors that make it appealing to buyers and investors.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Employment Opportunities</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        One of the biggest driving factors that causes the price of homes to increase is the number of employment opportunities available in the area. Where there are jobs, there are people, and where there are people, there is a need for homes. Areas with a healthy economy and a growing number of jobs available are often areas where home prices are increasing. If you're looking to invest in real estate with the goal that your property will appreciate over time, it may be wise to look for areas that have a growing labor market as well.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Proximity to Key Locations</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Another important thing to consider when purchasing a home is how easy is it to access certain key locations. Some of the locations to consider include the following:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul class="blog-post-list">
                            <li>Work</li>
                            <li>Schools</li>
                            <li>Highways</li>
                            <li>Hospitals</li>
                            <li>Gas Stations</li>
                            <li>Recreation</li>
                            <li>Shopping</li>
                        </ul>
                        People tend to enjoy convenience, and a property that is located closer to key amenities like these may be considered more valuable or may be easier to resell later. A good exercise when buying a house is to list out each of these items and research how far each one is from the property. Doing this can help you notice long commute times or other accessibility issues before you invest your money.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Crime Rates</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        It's always a good idea to check the local crime rates of an area before buying a property. Safe areas will have higher property values and higher rental incomes. Alternatively, areas with higher crime rates may sell for cheaper but are likely a riskier investment since they could be harder to resell later, or renters may be less likely to pay each month.
                        <br><br>
                        Also, you will probably want to check and see if there are any registered sex offenders in the area. Buying a home next door to a registered sex offender could significantly reduce the value of your home. As a result, it's something you want to be aware of before making a purchase.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Pride of Ownership</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Take a drive through the neighborhood and look at the houses nearby. Pay attention to whether people take care of their yards or not and notice what kinds of cards they drive. Doing this can help you quickly get a feel for the type of people that live in the neighborhood. Well-taken-care-of neighborhoods can play on buyer's emotions and command a higher price point than shoddy neighborhoods. 
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, you should be aware of the neighborhood because as an investor it is typically much better to buy the worst home in the best neighborhood than it is to buy the best home in the worst neighborhood. This is because buying the worst home in the area means there is room for improvement, and any improvements you do on the home will likely pay for themselves and then some. Additionally, it should make the neighbors happy, because by improving the worst home on the block you are helping the whole neighborhood become a little nicer, and it should increase the neighbor's home values as well.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">"For Rent" and "For Sale" Signs</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Watch out for neighborhoods that have a lot of "for rent" or "for sale" signs. This can often be a red flag that people don't want to live there. Be especially wary of multiple "for rent" signs in the neighborhood if your plan is to invest in a rental property because it may be an indicator that the local market is oversaturated with renters.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand, however, a lot of properties for sale could mean that you have more leverage as a buyer and may be able to negotiate a better deal on a property.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">School Districts</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        School districts are very important for potential buyers and renters. Pay attention to which school boundaries the property falls in, because school boundaries don't always line up with city lines, and it could be the reason two properties across the street from each other sell for substantially different prices. Being aware of the school district boundaries can help prevent you from finding yourself in a situation where a home isn't valued for as much as you thought it would be or is harder to sell than you thought it would be.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Functional & External Obsolescence</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Watch out for homes that have lower value due to inherent features or external factors that are difficult to change. An example of functional obsolescence is a home located near railroad tracks. It may have a lower value than homes in a quieter location, and that is a difficult thing to change. You can't just go tear out the tracks to increase the value of the property. An of functional obsolescence is homes that don't fit in with other homes in the area, such as a 1 bed 1 bath house in a neighborhood filled with 4 bed 2 bath houses. It can be ok to buy properties with functionally obsolete factors if you are aware of the issues and have a plan to deal with them.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Construction</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Make note of any new developments in the area. If there are new roads, restaurants, office buildings, apartment complexes or other structures being built it could affect the value of nearby properties and may also be an indicator that properties in the area are increasing in value. Local governments try to invest in up-and-coming locations, and they also sometimes make investments to improve run down areas of town. So, if you notice major improvements being done by the city, it may be a sign that local officials think this is a place worth investing in, since that is where they are investing. Additionally, if you notice privately owned business being built, such as franchise restaurants, it is a good indicator that other investors also find this area worth investing in. Just noticing what is being built nearby is a quick way to get a feel for how other people view the area without having to do any real research.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Home Values</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        This technique for evaluating a neighborhood is so obvious it almost goes without saying. It is always a good idea to look at the estimated value of homes in the neighborhood to get a sense of how much a particular home in that area will sell for. Often, nearby homes offer the best comparable prices when evaluating a property because location is so crucial in real estate appraisals.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Traffic Maps</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Many potential buyers like the idea of living in a quiet neighborhood. So, the question is, what counts as quiet. That's a subjective opinion that will vary from person to person, but there are good methods you can use to quickly evaluate whether a home of interest is in "a quiet neighborhood" or not. Traffic maps are one of the easiest ways to do this. Google maps has a traffic map that will show you how busy streets are by highlighting busy streets in red and vacant streets in white. The busier the street the darker the red line will be. It only takes a second to pull up google maps, see how the neighborhood looks, and compare it to other neighborhoods.
                        <br><br>
                        Another easy way to evaluate traffic is to sit across the street from the house you are considering investing in and simply counting how many cars drive by in a given time period. You will intuitively be able to tell whether it feels "busy" or not. Also note that homes located in cul-de-sacs are generally considered quieter than homes located on other streets. 
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Comprehensive Zoning Map</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Every city should have a comprehensive zoning map which specifies how each property is currently zoned. Zoning is the method cities use to control what types are properties are located where. This means that certain types of properties can only be built in certain locations. For example, a city may specify one area as low-density residential housing, another part of the city as high-density residential housing, and another part of the city as industrial manufacturing. They would require that single family homes be built in the low-density section of town, while apartment complexes are built in the high-density part of town, and a new factory is built in the industrial manufacturing area.
                        <br><br>
                        It's important to know how an area is zoned because it will be subject to certain restrictions. Here are a few of the most common zoning restrictions:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul class="blog-post-list">
                            <li>Height and bulk restrictions - Restrictions governing how tall buildings can be and how much space the building can occupy on the property.</li>
                            <li>Lot size restrictions - Restrictions governing the size of a lot.</li>
                            <li>Setback restrictions - Restrictions governing how far a structure can be built from the property line.</li>
                        </ul>
                        It's important to understand the basics of zoning as a beginner investor and it becomes crucial to understand if you find yourself investing in raw land or building new properties from the ground up. It can also be important if you intend to buy a property and use it for a new purpose. In some cases, you can apply for a zoning change for a property, but note that the process is often long and complicated. If you do find yourself in a situation where you want to apply for a zoning change, your best chance for success is if the new zoning matches the city's general plan.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">General Plan</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        The city's general plan is a broad overview of what the city hopes to see in the future. In many cases this will be slightly different than the comprehensive zoning map. It is important to be aware of the city's general plan for any areas you are considering investing in. You could run into issues if you purchase a property that doesn't align with the general plan, and you find yourself unable to use the property as you originally intended to.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Property Research</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        When analyzing an investment property, it's important to examine the neighborhood as well. Analyzing key aspects of the neighborhood can provide you with valuable information about the value of the property as well as any potential issues that may be hard to see at first. It's recommended that you always do thorough research before investing and my hope is that the topics discussed in this article have helped you identify several key areas to investigate.
