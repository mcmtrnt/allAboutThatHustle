                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">What is the Front-End DTI Ratio?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                       The front-end ratio, also commonly referred to as the housing ratio or the mortgage to income ratio, 
                       measures what percentage of a person's income goes towards their mortgage. It's a metric that lenders 
                       use to evaluate risk when screening potential clients because it gives insight into how likely it is 
                       that a person will be able to repay a loan. A low front-end ratio suggests you have sufficient income to 
                       cover your expenses and pay off your mortgage, while a high ratio means you may be more likely to default 
                       on a loan, and lenders will be more reluctant to loan you money.
                       <br><br>
                       The debt-to-income ratio is a good indicator of how much mortgage you can afford and signals how well 
                       you can handle debt. A good DTI may help you qualify for a mortgage, but don't panic if your front-end 
                       ratio isn't perfect. It's not the only piece of the puzzle. Lenders look at multiple criteria when evaluating 
                       applicants such as their income, credit score, savings accounts, debt obligations, and more.
                    </div>


                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">How is the Front-End DTI Ratio Calculated?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        Calculating your front-end ratio is easier than you may expect. Simply divide your monthly mortgage payment 
                        by your gross monthly income and multiply that number by 100. For example, if your monthly mortgage payment 
                        was $2,200, and your gross monthly income (before taxes) was $7,800, then your front-end ratio would be 
                        ($2,200 / $7,800) * 100 = 28%.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="blog-post-comment">
                            (Mortgage Pmt / Gross Monthly Income) * 100 = Front-End DTI Ratio
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        For this formula the mortgage payment includes PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance), 
                        mortgage insurance, HOA fees, and all other home related debt obligations.
                        <br><br>
                        It's important to note that the front-end ratio only considers housing expenses and doesn't 
                        consider any other forms of debt such as student loans, car payments, child support, or payments 
                        on rental properties. If you have other debts like this and are applying for a loan, it is important 
                        to also look at the back-end DTI ratio, which accounts for all forms of debt.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps the quickest and easiest way to calculate your front-end debt to income ratio is to use a 
                        free online calculator like the one at the top of this page.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">What is a Good Front-End Ratio?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        You now know what the front-end ratio is and why it's used. You also know the internals of how it is calculated 
                        and have probably used the calculator tool at the top of this page to figure out what your number is. If so, you 
                        may be wondering what a good front-end ratio is?
                        <br><br>
                        In most cases when applying for a loan the lender will want to see a front-end ratio that is less than 28%. 
                        However, if you're applying for an FHA loan the cutoff is typically 31% instead of 28%. 
                        This shows you have a health relationship with debt and most likely won't be overburdened with a mortgage payment. 
                        <br><br>
                        When it comes to DTI ratios, lower is better. A lower ratio may help you qualify for a mortgage easier 
                        and may allow you to borrow more money if needed.
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-h2">What to do if my Debt-To-Income Ratio is too High?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post-text">
                        If you find yourself in a situation where your debt-to-income ratio is preventing you from getting a loan, don't 
                        give up hope. That are several ways you can attempt to improve your situation. Some methods that may be worth 
                        pursuing include looking at different loan options, paying off debts or restructuring those debts to have 
                        smaller monthly obligations, getting a cosigner on your loan, increasing your income with a second job or a 
                        side hustle, or shopping for a lower mortgage rate. These strategies can lower your DTI ratio and help you 
                        qualify for a mortgage.
